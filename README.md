* 👨🏻‍💻 I'm all about Apex and how I can trick Salesforce into doing what I want it to do

I'm hanging out on GitHub to find interesting repos to incorporate into potential projects, and to sharpen the saw with frameworks and tools that I see myself, my customers, and other Salesforce Admins and Devs using in their daily lives.

I'm always up for a chat regarding code style, development in general, and implementation ideas!
